## 📝 Extended Description

This Social Media App is a full-featured platform designed to connect people, share ideas, and foster online communities.  
It replicates the core functionality of popular social networking sites but in a lightweight, customizable, and scalable structure suitable for both personal projects and professional deployment.

The application enables users to:
- **Create a personal account** through a secure registration process using Firebase Authentication.
- **Build their online presence** by customizing profile pictures, bios, and cover images.
- **Post updates in real time**, whether in text, images, or links, allowing users to express themselves freely.
- **Engage with others** through likes, comments, and replies, creating interactive discussions.
- **Access content instantly** thanks to real-time synchronization with Firestore Database — no page refresh needed.
- **Enjoy the experience anywhere**, as the responsive design adapts perfectly to mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.

From a technical standpoint, the app uses **Angular** for a modular and maintainable front-end structure, **Tailwind CSS** for a sleek and responsive UI, and **Firebase** for backend services — including Authentication, Database, and Storage.  
This eliminates the need for a dedicated server, reduces deployment complexity, and ensures high scalability.
